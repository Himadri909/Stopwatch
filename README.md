# Stopwatch
The stopwatch is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users start, stop, and reset time easily. HTML gives structure, CSS makes it look clean, and JavaScript handles real-time counting with functions like setInterval. This project is great for beginners to learn DOM manipulation and event handling.
